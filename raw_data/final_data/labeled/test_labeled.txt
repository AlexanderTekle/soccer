WHAT A LOVELY STRIKE! ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL FROM MESSI! He put it exactly where he wanted to, up and over the wall in the top-right corner - beating the goalkeeper as well as Dani Garcia, who had positioned himself by the post. 1-0 to the hosts! ,1

However, there is going to be a VAR check for offside.,1
GOOOOOOAAAAALLLLL!!! BOURNEMOUTH TAKE THE LEAD! Well, totally against the run of play, the visitors are 1-0 up.

GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! HAALAND CONVERTS THIS ONE!!! 1-0 DORTMUND!!! The visitors take a deserved lead as Haaland scores from close range. Brandt is played into space down the right flank and he cuts the ball back for Reyna in the middle. The midfielder knocks a delightful offload with a deft touch to his team-mate. Haaland collects the pass and delivers a crisp finish on his left foot past Gulacsi.,1

With five minutes to go, Di Francesco is forced into another round of substitutions as they once again chase a result. Captain and goal scorer Mazzitelli is withdrawn in favour of Ibrahimovic.,0

Seven minutes after going behind by a second goal, Cadiz make another change as Ramos comes off in favour of Juanmi.,0

GOALLLL! FERNANDES SCORES! 1-0 UNITED! What a penalty from Fernandes! The captain is cool under pressure, curling his penalty into the bottom-right corner. Pickford goes the right way, but he is beaten by the accuracy of the strike.,1
Balerdi is replaced by debutant Raschl for the final 25 minutes. It has been a tough day at the office for the departing player.,0

A bright start to the second half from the hosts results in Shaw being shown a yellow card for fouling Reiter.,2
GOAL! SIX! SIX GOALS! Grealish gets in on the act, and yet again it's a horrible deflection. Villa press Firmino in midfield, Watkins finds Grealish in his customary place on the left and his right-footed shot takes a huge deflection off Fabinho and into the bottom right.,1
GOOOALLLL! It's 2-0, it's Watkins again, and it's an absolute stunner! Grealish threads him in down the left with an excellent pass and the new boy just drives infield, leaving Gomez in his wake before firing a rocket of a shot into the top-right corner. Brilliant.,1
ARSENAL PEGGED BACK - EVERTON LEAD 1-0! A long throw from Digne - where his heel just appeared to be on the line - is flicked on at the near post and not dealt with by Arsenal, as it eventually bounces kindly into the path of Jagielka who turns it into an empty net from five yards!,1
Guendouzi picks up a yellow card as he arrives late and stomps on the foot of Digne, unintentionally, which leaves the full-back on the ground in need of some treatment.,2

A first swap for Ajax and it comes in midfield as Van de Beek, who will surely lose sleep after that latest missed chance, is replaced by youth product De Wit, who makes his debut in the competition proper.,0
Palace also make a solitary change, as Matheus Franca comes into midfield in place of Hughes for the visitors.,0
Having scored his first and Newcastle's fourth of the game, Wilson also heads off to be replaced up front by Alexander Isak.,0
Guimaraes also heads off, and the under-fire Sandro Tonali, in the headlines for off-field betting incidents, enters the fray in place of the Brazilian.,0
GOOOOAAAALLL!!! It's four!!!! After a good save from Doucoure, Pope launches the ball forward at speed and Trippier releases Murphy into space.

GOOOOOAAAALLL!!! And they've got another!!! The Geordies are in dreamland as Guehi fails to deal with a long ball from the back.

Palace are wilting as the Magpies soar, and it's 3-0 in this one-sided first half!,1
Allegri makes his third change, replacing his goalscorer, Kean, with Morata up front as he looks to get his side back in front.,0
GOAL!!! KEAN FIRES JUVENTUS IN FRONT!!! Bonucci knocks the ball long for Rabiot, who nods down to Kean on the edge of the box.

It's 1-0 to Juventus!,1

Watkins turns provider this time, teeing up the substitute for a corker of a finish, curled in off the right post from outside the box!,1
Dunk is the latest man into the book. It's not readily obvious why, but it may be for some words to the referee.,2
Welbeck is into the book too, with a yellow card for a lunge that takes Kamara’s legs out from beneath him.,2
Now Digne is into the book as he cuts down a Brighton counter-attack, and the referee shows him a yellow card without hesitation.,2

GOAL! Man City have the breakthrough, they lead 1-0! Grealish lays the ball back to Cancelo on the edge of the box, who drills a low effort towards goal, but it is superbly blocked by Soyuncu. However, he can’t stop the rebound from falling straight to Bernardo Silva, who fires it into the back of the net from close range.,1
Arsenal's first change of the game sees Martinelli replaced by Trossard, who scored just minutes after coming on against Brentford on Saturday.,0
GREALISH SCORES! It's a poor pass from Gabriel, and De Bruyne is right behind him to cut it out. Haaland drives into the box and it's squared to Gundogan, who flicks it onto Grealish. He has a free run onto the ball and keeps his shot low as he hits it first time. It takes a deflection which catches out Ramsdale and it rolls into the back of the net. 2-1 City!,1

GOOOAAAALLLLL!! 2-0 ARSENAL!! From a corner, Saka plays it short to Odegaard who quickly turns and returns the favour.

It falls to the feet of White inside the box, and he curls the ball into the bottom corner, leaving Petrovic with no chance!,1
It's 2-0!!! A corner ends up with Foden having the ball, and the youngster lets fly from 30 yards out. The shot deflects off Mwepu and completely wrongfoots Sanchez, before nestling into the bottom corner.,1
Edouard started the game up front but failed to have a shot in the match. Rak-Sakyi is on for the final three minutes.,0
Palace make the first change of the game. Schlupp has been fantastic in this game and put Palhinha and Ream on yellow cards, but he is now coming off. Mateta takes his place.,0

Bedlam in the stands and bewilderment on the faces of the Spurs players, as Newcastle double their lead almost instantly!,1

Rodrigo Duarte Ribeiro will also come on to freshen up the Forest midfield, replacing Danilo in the centre of the park.,0

GOOOAAALLL! Palace equaliser, it's 2-2! The visitors have their first corner of the game after Ayew's shot is blocked. Tomkins is unmarked at the far post, he powers his header into the bottom corner. He made it look easy, but poor defending by Liverpool to allow Palace back into this game.,1
Ezzalzouli has been superb in this game, and the youngster comes off to rapturous applause as Alejandro Balde comes on.,0
GOOOOAAAALLLLL!!! That might just win it for Barca! Some silky play on the edge of the box puts Gaviria through on the left side. He cuts it back for Gonzalez, and the substitute takes a touch before firing the shot into the top corner, to make it 3-2 to the hosts!,1
Elche look to break through Perez, but he's brought down from behind by Garcia as he knocks the ball past him. We reckon that won't be the last yellow card of the evening, judging by the nature of this game at the moment.,2
GOOOOOAAAAALLLLLL!!!! There's the opener!!! Ezzalzouli wins a corner and in it comes from Dembele. It's a good cross, and it's Jutgla who rises highest to head the ball into the far corner on his first La Liga start! What a finish, and what a moment for the youngster who makes it 1-0 to Barca!,1
GOAL! Minamino makes it 3-0! Brentford try to play it out from the back, but Firmino wins it off Norgaard right on the edge of the box and he lays it off to Minamino. They then play a quick one-two in the six-yard box, before Minamino slides the ball home from close range. Poor by Brentford, they’ve handed Liverpool a goal on a plate there.,1
Ajer is shown the first yellow card of the game after he dives into a challenge with Jota and catches him late, getting nowhere near the ball. No complaints by the Brentford defender.,2
Beto rolls past Berge on the left touchline, with the Burnley man pulling his shirt back. He is then shown a yellow card. Everton are getting closer to securing a huge three points.,2
Kompany makes a change immediately after O'Shea's red card. Bruun Larsen has looked quiet on the wing and is replaced by Brownhill, who should solidify the midfield.,0
GOAL! 2-0 Madrid! You thought they'd score but not like that. What an error by Leganes! Bustinza sells Cuellar short with a terrible back-pass. The keeper rushes out, but Benzema is first to it and passes back to Vicinius. The Brazilian could shoot but smartly lays off to Vasquez who thumps the ball into an empty net. Shambolic defending there. ,1
Liverpool are making a triple change as they look to see out their win. Robertson is the first to go off, with Tsimikas on for him.,0
Pedri's not had the space, time or service to be at his best so far, and comes off now for a fellow youngster - semi-final scorer Lamine Yamal - to make an impact in the final half-hour of this game.,0
GOOOOAAAAALLL!!! The Blaugrana pull one back!!! Barca flood the Madrid box with numbers and work the ball patiently forward until Blade crosses from the left.

Young Zvonarek's goal-scoring day comes to a close as 18-year-old Asp-Jensen comes on for the final moments here.,0

A like-for-like change in the middle for the Saints as Romeu comes on and Hojbjerg goes off. The player to make way has come close to scoring on a couple of occasions today.,0
GOOOOOALLL!! Tottenham 1-0 Southampton! That man Kane opens the scoring for Spurs with a decent finish at the near post. Eriksen creates it with a low cross, rather than going deep as many expected, and Kane is there to tuck it past McCarthy from four yards out. ,1
GOOOOOAAAALLLLL!!!! WOW!!!! Linares have the opener!!! Carnicer has it on the right, and places a fantastic cross right into the six-yard box. Diaz beats his man to connect with the ball, and diverts a brilliant low header into the bottom corner to make it 1-0! An upset of epic proportions is on the cards here!,1
GOOAAALLLL!!! FIRMINO! Liverpool lead! Mane gets in once again and this time does not go for goal, playing a ball across the face of goal that Lloris and Dier both inexplicably leave. Firmino is arriving and has a tap-in for 1-0!,1
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!! WOOD CAPITALISES ON A TERRIBLE XHAKA MISTAKE!!!!! 1-1!!!! The Clarets are gifted a way back into the game by Xhaka. The midfielder slams a clearance off the body of Wood as he tries to clear across the face of his own goal. It strikes the New Zealander on the hip and travels into the back of the net. Arteta is furious on the touchline.,1
A final change for Mallorca as Abdon replaces two-goal Budimir, who can be pleased with his day's work.,0
BUDIMIR PULLS ONE BACK! 2-1! Well, that wasn't in the script! From one of their first attacks of the game, Mallorca halve the deficit. Budimir races onto a through ball into the box and his effort deflects off Lenglet before looping over the helpless Ter Stegen.,1
WHAT A GOAL FROM MESSI!!! 2-0! Fresh from landing a sixth Ballon d'Or crown, Messi celebrates the occasion in the way that he knows best - with an absolutely glorious goal. Receiving the ball 25 yards from goal, he bends it beautifully into the top corner in trademark fashion - leaving Reina with no chance at all.,1
Moreno has barely had a kick tonight and he is replaced by Mo Gomez for the final 22 minutes of the game. ,0
GOAAAALLLL!!!! BARCELONA 2-1 VILLARREAL - Cazorla decides he wants to try and win goal of the match as he lets fly from lone range, just like Arthur. The former Arsenal midfielder escaped from his marker and went for goal, with his shot swerving right to left. The spin confused Ter Stegen, and he is beaten just before half-time.,1
GOALLL!!! 1-0 INTER!!! LUKAKU!!! The hosts score inside the opening minute as Lukaku takes the ball around Sportiello and taps it into the empty net! The striker plays a give-and-go with Martinez and has plenty of time to decide how to shoot. He waits for the goalkeeper to make his move and makes no mistake with the rest.,1
Vinicius makes it 2-0!!! It's brilliant from Asensio and Benzema to link up and then pick out the Brazilian in the middle, who lashed it into the back of the net to double his side's advantage.,1
GOOOAAALLL!!! JUVENTUS 1-0 CHIEVO! Costa opens the scoring for Juve with his first goal of the campaign. The Brazil winger carries the ball a good 20 yards through the middle of the pitch before picking out the bottom corner from outside the box, invited to do so by Radovanovic and Bani after they both turned their backs.,1
GOAL! Fati marks his return to the Barca side with a goal and makes it 3-0 in stoppage time! Barca counter quickly and Depay dummies the ball, which is picked up by Fati, who races forward from deep and then fires a low strike towards goal from the edge of the box, which Fernandez doesn't see until late and he is unable to stop it from flying in.,1
De Jong also makes way and Fati is his replacement. The youngster is given a huge round of applause upon his return to the pitch, after 10 months out injured.,0
Another double change by the visitors, with De Frutos the first to head off the pitch and he has been replaced by Cantero.,0
Depay sprints down the left wing and Postigo has to step across him and pull him back in order to stop him from getting any further. A blatant foul and booking for the Levante skipper.,2
GOAL! Depay converts from the penalty spot to send Barcelona ahead after just seven minutes, it's 1-0! Depay won the penalty after a clumsy challenge by Radoja and he coolly stepped up to take it, sending Fernandez the wrong way and firing the ball into the bottom left corner of the net.,1
LYON SCORE AGAIN! 2-0! It's an almost identical goal to the first! This time, Terrier tackles Mukiele after the defender attempted to dribble past him, and with no defenders left, Terrier is free to round Gulasci and tap into an empty net!,1
GOOOOAAALLL!!! NORWICH 1-2 CHELSEA! Mount makes it two goals in two games - what a player he looks to be! Norwich try to play the ball out from the back, fail to do so and Pulisic slips the ball into the feet of Mount, who brings it inside and fires a shot past Krul.,1
GOOOOAAALLL!!! NORWICH 1-1 CHELSEA! Talk about a quick response! Less than three minutes after falling behind, Norwich get themselves back on level terms at a rocking Carrow Road. Cantwell shows some good footwork and plays the ball across to Pukki, who lays it on a plate for his team-mate to side-foot through the legs of Kepa from close range.,1
De Jong isn't happy about the result and takes his frustration out on the referee who shows him a yellow card after the full-time whistle has gone! ,2
Only on the pitch for a handful of minutes, Long trips Odegaard in midfield and is booked by the referee.,2
A second attack-minded change is effected by Arteta, with Tavares being replaced by Pepe on the wing.,0
Receiving the first booking of the game, Broja sees yellow for a brief collision with White on the edge of the Arsenal area. In the context of decisions during the first half, that seems a harsh call by the referee.,2
GOAL! ATLETICO MADRID 1-0 REAL SOCIEDAD! Atletico have gotten off to a flyer! The hosts take the corner short and keep possession. Llorente picks out Carrasco who takes a great touch with the outside of his wrong foot and rolls the ball underneath Remiro.,1
Milan now make their final change of the game, with Borini coming off and he has been replaced by Conti.,0
GOOOAAAALLL! Milan double their lead, it's 2-0! Kessie was the provider for the first and now he has scored the second! Superb move and finish from the midfielder, who showed great feet in the box to shift the ball away from his marker and then power it into the top corner.,1
2-0! What a stroke of fortune for Eibar! Another Orellana cross is hacked clear, but only as far as Arbilla who leathers a savage shot at goal: it looks relatively straightforward for Oblak, but it takes a deflection off Giminez and into the roof of the net! Oblak stood no chance after that deviation took the shot away from his grasp!  ,1
EIBAR TAKE THE LEAD! The away side hit Atletico on the break brilliantly there! Leon began the move by driving at the home side's backline, before slipping Orellana in behind, who simply clipped a cross in for the unmarked Charles to power past Oblak!  ,1
The first yellow card of the game is shown to Coleman, after he reacts badly to a decision and clashes with Ait Nouri.,2
GOAL! EVERTON PULL ONE BACK! The visitors are back in it as Iwobi makes it 2-1! They work it well in the final third and Godfrey fires a low strike at goal from the edge of the box, but this effort is accidentally blocked by Keane. However, the rebound falls straight to Iwobi, who drills it into the bottom right corner of the net.,1
Veltman is withdrawn for Burn, which could see a reshuffle for the home side. White may slide out to wing-back, while Burn slots into the defence.,0
Zaza reacts angrily to getting booked for bringing down Dalbert with the latter running with the ball. Both sides now have three bookings apiece.,2
Paqueta makes a reckless challenge as he tracks Elmas down Napoli's left flank. The Brazilian isn't happy as the referee gets his yellow card out.,2
Diaby comes off late for Leverkusen, and Adam Hlozek enters the fray hoping to make a late impact up front.,0
Lazare is just getting to his feet after a foul by Hincapie, but is then brushed in the face by the Ecuadorian and hits the deck once more! There's barely a sniff of contact, but just the intent of that is enough for the referee to show Hincapie a yellow card.,2
GOOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!!!!! Superb from Saint-Gilloise, and their main man opens the scoring!! The visitors break from Leverkusen's free-kick, but Hradecky races a mile out of his box to clear the ball. Union recycle possession quickly though, and Teuma finds Boniface in acres of space. He drives into the box and stands up Tapsoba, before firing a low shot right into the bottom corner! No chance there for Hradecky, and the Nigerian gives his side a 1-0 lead!,1
Leverkusen make one half-time change, as Kerem Demirbay comes on for Palacios at the base of their midfield.,0
McKENNIE!!! 3-1 JUVENTUS! An immediate impact by the substitute! Within two minutes of coming on, the American international beats the offside trap and races onto a neat through ball, before calmly slotting past Perin from close range.,1
MORATA!!! 2-0 JUVENTUS! The Bianconeri hit Genoa with a devastating counter! Chiesa leads the charge and his eventual shot is parried into the path of Ronaldo, who somehow hits the post from a couple of yards out. Thankfully, Morata is quickly there to ruthlessly tuck away the rebound.,1
Cuadrado blocks Zappacosta's attempted cross with his arm just outside the box and goes into the book.,2
GOAL! Rennes have doubled their lead straight from the restart! Tait makes it 2-0 just seconds after the game kicks off. Rennes broke quickly up the pitch and PSG just couldn’t get close to them. Laborde sprints down the right wing, before drilling a cross into the box from the byline, which is met by Tait in the box and he slides the ball into the bottom left corner of the net.,1
Alexander-Arnold has to enter the action to replace an ailing Lovren, which should see Gomez move into the middle of the defence.,0
Szoboszlai receives a standing ovation from the Anfield faithful as the midfielder makes way for youngster McConnel.,0
Back-to-back bookings come in a matter of seconds as Jota is once again felled by Ajer. The Brentford defender joins team-mate Norgaard in the referee’s book.,2
Youngster Duffus also makes his way onto the pitch for the final couple of minutes. Ferguson comes off, with the Seagulls now lacking a physical presence in the attack.,0
Pineda was lively in the first half and got plenty of shots away, but his impact has waned since the red card. Pizarro is on.,0
AEK are taking their frustrations out on Brighton and are making a couple of poor fouls. This time, Zuber jumps into Gilmour and goes into the book as a result.,2
GOAL!!! ARSENAL ARE RAMPANT!!! They come forward with another neat move, with Havertz laying it to his left for Martinelli. The left winger cuts in and shoots, and though Samba saves, he can only parry it straight into the path of Saka, who diverts into the back of the net with his thigh. 3-0 to Arteta's men!,1
It's quite brilliant from Vinicius who makes it 3-0! He does superbly to weave his way into the box and shift onto his left foot, before driving his effort into the back of the net. That is surely the goal that finishes this game off.,1
GOOOOAAALLLL!! VAN DIJK ADDS MORE GLOSS TO THE PROCEEDINGS! Milner's corner is flicked on by Mane at the near post, and the centre-back ghosts inside the six-yard area to power it home past Casillas to make it 4-1 on the night and 6-1 on aggregate!,1

Soares also comes on for Otavio as Conceicao looks to switch up his attacking options in search of a goal or four.,0
Firmino comes on for Origi as Klopp makes his first change of the match just as the second half is about to commence.,0
He would’ve been odds-on to get at least a yellow card, and Pepe fails to disappoint by getting his name in Makkeile’s book for bundling Origi over as the forward was about to turn and make a break for it.,2
GOOOOAAAAALLLLL!!!!! A Bayern firecracker puts them into the lead!!! Die Roten work the ball well around the box, and Hernandez passes back inside to Coman. From 20 yards, he smashes a shot that curls, dips and swerves on its way to goal, deceiving Luthe and finding the back of the net! What a goal, and Bayern are up 1-0 in no time at all.,1
GOAL! Mbappe fires PSG into the lead from the penalty spot, they lead 2-1! PSG have come from behind to fire themselves in front late on!

Double substitution coming up by the visitors, with Boufal the first to come off and he has been replaced by Ounahi.,0
GOAL! Angers take the lead, it’s 1-0! They counter quickly up the pitch after winning the ball back in midfield and Boufal gets down the right wing, then drills a low cross into the penalty area, which Fulgini meets and powers it into the back of the net from close range. Donnarumma had no chance of stopping that. PSG have to come from behind!,1
GOOOOAAAALLL!!!! A stroke of luck doubles PSG's lead!!! Ugarte does superbly to go past two defenders on the turn before feeding Vitinha, whose shot from the edge of the box deflects off the knee of Lloris, leaving Desmas rooted to the spot as the ball sails into the top-right corner!! 2-0 to the visitors, and despite the best efforts of Le Havre at the other end, it's PSG who'll be taking the points back to Paris.,1
Danilo takes an age to take a routine PSG throw-in, but his time-wasting is soon clamped down on by the referee showing him a yellow card.,2

Le Havre make two substitutions at half-time, with Nego withdrawn and Nabil Alioui introduced in a clear statement of attacking intent.,0
RED CARD!!! PSG are down to 10 men!! A long ball over the top is missed by their central defence and draws Donnarumma well out of his box. Casimir knocks the ball past him and is met with a flailing high boot which takes him to ground, and results in a straight red card for the Paris goalkeeper! They've already had one player leave the pitch injured, and now another follows with PSG a man down for the next 80 minutes.,3
De Bruyne heads off with a few minutes to spare. City play Liverpool this weekend after all. Nmecha is on for him.,0
Higuain, who has been ineffective throughout his Premier League debut, is hooked off for Giroud as Sarri looks to switch up his attacking options.,0
GOOOOAAAALLLL!!! BOURNEMOUTH TAKE THE LEAD!! Brooks again at the heart of the Cherries’ attacking play as he receives a throw-in before cutting the ball back to King, who has all the time to power it past Arrizabalaga! 90 seconds into the second half, and it’s 1-0 to Bournemouth!,1
Huszti has struggled to influence the game in the second half and is replaced by Hodzic for the final 10 minutes or so.,0
GOAL MANCHESTER CITY - Aguero with a clean pair of heels, as he crosses it into the box for Sane, who sends it from right to left, for Sterling to tap it in past Ryan. Manchester City 1 - Brighton & Hove Albion 0.,1
WHAT A GOAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ASENSIO SCORES A STUNNER!!!!! 2-0!!!!! Madrid extend their advantage to all but secure the three points through a super strike from Asensio. It's straight off the training ground as Kroos works a short pass to the Spaniard from the left flank and he hammers his left-footed strike away from Gulacsi into the right side of the net.,1
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!! VALVERDE PRODUCES A SUBLIME FINISH!!!! 1-0 MADRID!!!!! Los Blancos break the deadlock with a fine team move that Valverde finishes with a crisp strike on his left foot. Vinicius picks out the run of Valverde with a cross-field pass on the right flank. He cuts inside to open up space for a curling effort that finds the bottom-left corner.,1
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!! BENZEMA LEVELS FOR MADRID!!!! 1-1!!!! The Spanish side are level on the night as Benzema converts on the volley. Marcelo whips a dangerous cross to the back post for Casemiro to rise and head across goal. Militao helps it into the path of the awaiting Benzema, who reacts and steers an effort past Mendy with power into the back of the net.,1
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!! PULISIC FIRES CHELSEA AHEAD!!!!! 1-0!!!! The Blues take a deserved lead through the American. Rudiger floats a sublime ball over the top for Pulisic to chase. He collects in the left-inside channel and is afforded space and time on the box. He takes it round Courtois before hammering a right-footed strike through two players on the line into the back of the net. ,1
A clash between Benteke and Elneny sparks tempers now as we get back underway, and the former is booked for his part in a scuffle that sees plenty of players muscle up against each other.,2
GOOOAAALLL! Hoffenheim have got their equaliser, it's 3-3! To their credit they've kept on pushing forward in search of a goal and they've finally got the breakthrough, Joelinton with the goal. The substitute smashes the ball into the top corner after a low ball across the six-yard box by Schulz. Could they now go on and win it?,1
GOOOAAALLL! Lyon now lead 3-2! What a game this is turning out to be, the visitors have come from behind to now lead and put themselves in control. It's a wonderful individual goal by Depay after a long hopeful ball comes his way, the winger makes a darting run which confuses his marker who messes up his clearance. Depay then runs clear on goal and slides the ball under Baumann and into the far corner of the net.,1
Hoffenheim make their first change of the game following the equalising goal, with Szalai the man coming off and he is replaced by Joelinton.,0
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!! RODRYGO GETS A GOAL BACK!!!!!! 1-1!!!!! Madrid have a glimmer of hope as Rodrygo converts at the near post. Benzema steers a cross from Camavinga towards the middle and Rodrygo reacts ahead of Ederson to fire home.,1
LUKAKU MAKES IT THREE! It’s a simple tap-in finish after a short-corner routine. Mata passes to Lingard and continues his run, receiving the ball back as he approaches the byline and immediately centring it for Lukaku who slots it home with his left foot!,1
GOOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!! AUBAMEYANG SCORES! Is that the goal that sends Arsenal through? They have completed the turnaround – Saka delivering a wonderful cross to the back post, where Aubameyang is on hand to nod home. It’s 3-2 Arsenal, and the Gunners are going through!,1
An attacking change from Arteta, though Arsenal fans may question why it did not come slightly earlier. Lacazette is on, replacing Bellerin, and it seems Saka will switch to right-back.,0
Stoger ignores the referee's instructions about taking a quick free-kick and has his name taken for it. ,2
Sane's frustration is starting to show as he clatters Burkardt from behind. He kicks the ball out of play after the free-kick is given, and he's booked for dissent.,2
Modric clips De Bruyne to halt the City playmaker's run and is shown the first yellow card of the match.,2
After a free-kick decision does not go Crystal Palace's way, Hughes sees yellow for showing dissent towards the referee.,2
GOAL! MANCHESTER UNITED 1-0 BRIGHTON AND HOVE ALBION! Ronaldo gives United the lead with a thunderous strike! Bissouma's closed down in midfield by McTominay who finds United's talisman on the edge of the box. The 37-year-old skips over a challenge and blasts the ball past Sanchez into the bottom right corner.,1
Yep, it is difficult to argue there. Pedro fouls him and as the Brazilian goes by James kicks out at him. It went to VAR and the referee quickly made his decision. James is sent off.,3
Lamptey makes way for Offiah. He was lucky to not be sent off for his foul on Mudryk, but he was really positive against his former club.,0
Mudryk went straight down the tunnel and is substituted due to concussion protocols. Nkunku is coming on and it has been a stop-start first year to his Chelsea career.,0
It is a pretty simple yellow card, Jackson was just about to get into the box but he got shoved to the ground by Dunk.,2
Molinaro becomes the second Frosinone player to get in referee Giua’s book following a previous challenge on Cancelo where there was no intention to play the ball.,2
After conceding the first foul of the match as early as the first minute, Can becomes the first player booked for a needless handball in the centre of the pitch in an attempt to stop a Frosinone break.,2
GOOOOAAALLLL!!! AN OUTSTANDING FINISH BY DYBALA!! The Argentina forward takes one touch after being played in by Ronaldo, and he strikes the ball with such venom from about 30 yards that the sprawling Sportiello had no chance! 1-0 to the Old Lady, who gain the early advantage as Dybala scores his first Serie A goal since the first weekend of November!,1
Bordalas has turned to his bench for the first time today, bringing on Rodriguez for Maksimovic up top.,0
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!! FIDEL CONVERTS!!! 1-1!!!! The home side are back in the game as Fidel beats Courtois from 12 yards. The winger strikes the ball hard and low with his left foot to find the bottom-left corner. Courtois goes the right way, but cannot reach it. Game on.,1
GORETZKA SCORES! He's the one that intercepts Hinteregger's pass and the rebound bounces into Lewandowski. He drives through the middle to get on the end of the return pass and coolly slots his effort past Trapp and into the far bottom corner. 1-0 Bayern! ,1
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!! AGUERO RESTORES CITY'S LEAD!!!! 2-1!!! Patience from the hosts allows them to regain the lead. Bernardo Silva and De Bruyne open up Spurs down the right flank. The Belgian fires a low ball into the middle where Aguero makes his run across Alderweireld. He clips the ball past Lloris from close range into the left bottom corner.,1
Last change for Arsenal now as we head into stoppage time. Aubameyang is taken off, with Martinelli on to replace him.,0
Villa try to break on the counter and Aubameyang pushes Luiz down to stop it which earns him a yellow card.,2
SMITH ROWE SCORES! Smith Rowe starts the move when he intercepts McGinn's throughball deep in his own half. He drives down the left before being picked out by Aubameyang and he's got acres of space to run into. He takes his shot from inside the box and a deflection off Mings wrongfoots Martinez and sends it in off the inside of the near post. 3-0 Arsenal!,1
Lokonga slips and then grabs hold of McGinn's shirt to stop him from getting away. He gives away a free-kick and has his name taken by the referee. ,2
Mings stepped across Lacazette in an attempt to win the ball, catching the forward in the process. He's shown a yellow card.,2
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLL!!! VILLARREAL COMPLETE THE COMEBACK!! IT'S 3-2!!!!! Iborra puts his team ahead with a fine finish from close range to complete an incredible turnaround here. Morlanes spotted the midfielder's forward run behind the Barca defence in the left inside channel. Ter Stegen committed himself and the Spaniard lifted his effort over the keeper and into the right-bottom corner. What a game.,1
Funes Mori brings down Suarez on the charge. He goes into the book and hands Barca one final shooting attempt from distance before the end of the half.,2
Militao gets an early yellow card for tripping Garcia when he turns the Madrid defender in the centre of the pitch.,2
Soyuncu makes his way on to the field to replace Evans. That is a concern for the Foxes given Evans' recent injury woes.,0
Raphinha cuts inside and races over halfway looking to spark a counter-attack, but he's caught from behind by a sliding Pau Torres, who is booked by the referee for that clear foul.,2
Another defensive change coming for Barcelona, as Kounde comes off for Gerard Pique to see out the game.,0
Jackson's hardly had a kick in the final third, and comes off for Alberto Moreno in the visitors' latest substitution.,0
Conte signals his attacking intent as he brings off midfielder Gagliardini for forward Lukaku, who will join Martinez and Sanchez up top.,0
De Vrij goes flying through the back of Keita on the touchline and rightfully earns a place in referee Valeri's book.,2
Frosinone's final substitution is another attacking change, with Morocco international striker Cheddira taking Monterisi's place.,0
Another youngster gets valuable minutes for Milan, with Jovic making way for the 15-year old Camarda in a straight swap at striker.,0
The Milan supporters rise from their seats to applaud the long-awaited return of Bennacer, with the midfielder having finally fully recovered from his knee injury. He will take over for Reijnders with 11 minutes to go.,0
Di Francesco rolls the dice once again, looking for a way back into the match. Caso gets a chance to make his mark, with Ibrahimovic recalled to the bench.,0
Koeman decides to make a change. Dembele is on for Trincao who won't be scoring today but perhaps should have done.,0
Darian Males is on for Young Boys in their final change, and will replace Ugrinic in the centre of the visitors' midfield.,0
Elia's been unable to replicate his goalscoring feats of the home tie, and Congolese striker Silvere Ganvoula comes on for the final 12 minutes in place of his DR Congo compatriot.,0
RED CARD!!! That's certainly been coming for Lauper! The young Boys midfielder slides in late, and unnecessarily, on Ake, catching the City substitute late, and giving the referee no option but to show the second yellow card and send the midfielder off.,3
Grealish dispossesses Janko and plays the ball infield, but is caught very late by Lauper after releasing a pass. The Young Boys midfielder goes straight into the book, and that's a second card in just four minutes for the side in yellow and black.,2
Gomes knows what he is doing as he clips the ankles of Grealish, earning a booking for the Everton midfielder as well as offering City a free-kick in a promising wide position.,2
Akanji is eventually booked after a three-minute passage of play without the ball going out following his late challenge on Onana. The City centre-back protests his innocence, perhaps perplexed the referee remembered after such a long period of the game before coming back to discipline him.,2
Stones is no longer fit to continue after his earlier collision with Beto. The centre-back, who has already missed a portion of the season through injury, limps off against his former side as Gvardiol takes his place. Ake shifts inwards as the substitute slots in at left-back.,0
Patterson is the first name in referee Brooks' book after dragging down Grealish on the left-hand side with a cynical foul. The Everton right-back knew exactly what he was doing there.,2
Kompany is making a trio of changes as he tries to find an attacking spark. The first sees Rodriguez come on for Andouni.,0
We're about to get back underway. Aaron Connolly replaces Andraz Sporar in Middlesbrough's third change of the game.,0
RED CARD! Saelemaekers receives his marching orders after pulling back Ceppitelli as he looked to break. The Milan midfielder lasted less than 10 minutes.,3
Neves wasn't happy with Mepham's foul and he chases the referee down to make that point. Much to his surprise and frustration, he's shown a yellow card for dissent.,2
Amdouni got a goal and an assist in a matter of minutes and is also coming off for a rest. Redmond takes his place in the attack.,0
RED CARD! The Blades are two goals behind and are now down to 10 men. McBurnie crashes his arm into the face of O'Shea when jumping to win the ball in the air, with the referee giving a foul and a second yellow card for the striker.,3
Busquets gave away a free-kick after catching Aspas late, but then gets booked for dissent for his frustrated reaction.,2
Tapia slides in late on Balde to give away a free-kick and earn a yellow card which will see him miss the next match.,2
And Vazquez comes on for Mallo, who went down with what looked like a hamstring injury on the stroke of half-time.,0
Garcia clips the back of Aspas after stretching to try and intercept the pass. He's late and he's shown the first yellow card of the game.,2
Pacho steps in front of Sane to shield the ball, but the winger wraps an arm around his neck from behind to drag him out of the way. He goes into the referee's book.,2
It's going to be another double change for Bayern here. Surprisingly, the first to go off is Coman, who has provided the visitors' biggest threat today. He's replaced by Gnabry.,0
Athletic are making another double change here. Berenguer, who scored what is currently the winning goal here, is replaced by Vesga.,0
Atletico's final roll of the dice sees Riquelme brought on for the final 10 minutes or so in place of Lino.,0
And Guruzeta, who has been an isolated figure for much of the game, managing just one shot, also makes way. Villalibre replaces him.,0
Isak concedes a free-kick for a foul on Veltman, which Brighton want to take quickly but are prevented from doing so by Targett. That's time-wasting straight out of the textbook, and as such the Newcastle defender is shown a yellow card.,2
Neymar comes central to take a pass, stepping away from Pavard in the process, but he's caught late by the Bayern defender, who goes into the book.,2
Kilman is booked as he hacks down Tielemans on the right wing. That's definitely a case of inexperience from the Wolves centre-back. ,2
A yellow card is shown to Moreno in the 99th minute for his overzealous celebration that caused a bit of a fracas.,2
Gibbs-White drops deep to find Mangala on halfway but Gallagher is all over the Forest midfielder and pulls him down, conceding a free-kick and being shown a yellow card for his troubles.,2
A mistimed challenge on Harrison earns Patterson a yellow card. Another booking - will this game end with 11 men aside?,2
For a foul on McNeil, Llorente - who was at fault for the Everton goal - is now booked. Not a great game so far for the Leeds defender.,2
In a strange incident with Meslier, a cheeky flick of the boot by Davies towards the ball - which was still in the goalkeeper's gloves as he prepared to clear it - earns a booking.,2
Le Tallec hunts down Thiago Silva in an attempt to win the ball back high up the pitch, but clips the heels of the defender from behind and is instead shown a yellow card.,2
Drexler is involved straight away, receiving a booking after he lunged in on Schick. Angelino had broken from the loose ball, though Werner was offside anyway and the free-kick is awarded.,2
Vasquez sees the first yellow card of the game when he slides to reach a ball unaware that Lenglet is also on the scene.,2
It’s a yellow card for Lucas Torreira in his first Premier League start for Arsenal – a well-deserved booking for a two-footed slide tackle on Sigurdsson.,2
Hugo Bueno is booked for a cynical foul on Madueke, stopping the Chelsea wideman from escaping up the line with a clear trip.,2
Estupinan walks off with the ball after being flagged offside, and the referee books him for time-wasting.,2
Sarr jumped over the advertising boards to celebrate with the crowd, and he's booked for what is deemed an excessive celebration.,2
Maitland-Niles is the second Arsenal player to be booked, after his challenge on Moutinho in the Wolves half.,2
St. Juste clatters into the back of Lewandowski in the air. The Bayern staff suggest an elbow, while Svensson protests his centre-back's innocence. Referee Osmers dishes out his second Mainz yellow card in as many minutes to the defender.,2
The hosts' anger carries on as da Costa gets brought down in the middle of the park. Mainz's players gather around referee Osmers and the official shows a yellow card to Alaba, taking Bayern's yellow card tally to three for the first half.,2
A late booking comes the way of Davies now for a poor challenge. City are looking for a fourth, the icing on the cake.,2
Lamela has been skirting the edge of a yellow card all game and now he picks one up for a particularly clumsy challenge. Tottenham are getting frustrated.,2
Silva picks up the first booking of the game for a particularly brusque challenge. That was a little bit wasteful to get a yellow card.,2
No! The referee reviews the incident using VAR, blows his whistle and books Dessena for handball! The Cagliari captain is furious. To be fair, it did look like he handled it unfairly on the replay.,2
Casemiro slides in wildly on Fati from behind, getting none of the ball and earning a clear yellow card!,2
HE'S OFF! Moisander bodychecks Lewandowski as the striker flicks the ball past him and looks to break forward. The referee shows no hesitation in showing him his second yellow card and he has been dismissed.,3
RED CARD! Oh my word! Barcelona shoot themselves in the foot again! Rakitic lunges in on Lo Celso in midfield and picks up a deserved yellow card, which sees the referee issue marching orders to the Croatia midfielder.,3
REIMS ARE DOWN TO 10 MEN! Munetsi catches Verratti from behind and is shown a red card. It was far from malicious so that, on the face of it, appears to be a harsh decision.,3
RED CARD! Masuaku is off! It is an incredibly harsh decision from Mike Dean, but VAR cannot review a yellow-card offence. Masuaku dived in on El Mohamday, but hardly made any contact. The referee had made his mind up, however, with West Ham's protests falling on deaf ears.,3
MBAPPE IS SENT OFF! With two minutes remaining, the referee correctly shows the France international a straight red card for a horrible tackle on Da Silva near the Rennes corner flag. It was a dangerously high step into the shin of the centre-back. It’s a potentially leg-breaking challenge, which will see Mbappe play no further part in the cup final!    ,3
MAEDA IS SENT OFF!!! Things get worse for Celtic as the lively Maeda is given his marching orders for the challenge on Hermoso. His foot is high, but there does not seem to be much contact. It is a harsh one, and the visitors are now right up against it.,3
LAZARO IS SENT OFF! Zaha turned with the ball and was away and Lazaro drags him to ground in a desperate attempt to stop him. He's the last man and the referee has no option but to send him off!,3
CHELSEA DOWN TO 10! After pointing to the spot, the referee goes straight to his pocket and he's shown a straight red card to James for the handball on the line. It seems harsh as it bounced off his leg first, but he's told to leave the pitch.,3
ATLETI DOWN TO 10 MEN! Charging into midfield from his centre-back position, Felipe lifts his boot recklessly in a challenge with Arambarri and connects with his opponent's shoulder. With no hesitation from the referee, he is sent straight off, and the champions are a man down with more than 30 minutes left to play!,3
OFF! Gusto is sent off. Having initially been given a yellow card, Gusto's punishment is upgraded to a red for catching Digne on the ankle with an outstretched boot after a VAR check. Chelsea are down to 10 men.,3
PHILLIPS WALKS... Gibbs-White makes the most of a hot-headed Phillips challenge and as the Forest midfielder is caught by his marker, the ref's second yellow is already out of the pocket. On his second start for West Ham, Phillips receives his marching orders, ultimately falling foul to Dominguez and that petulant booking just minutes earlier.,3
FULHAM ARE DOWN TO 10 MEN! Graham Scott has a long look at Kamara's challenge on Eze on the monitor before going back over to the player and upgrades the yellow to a red and Fulham will have to play the last few minutes with 10 men.,3
JIMENEZ IS OFF! Meslier was first to the ball and Jimenez crashed into him, even though it seemed to be his momentum carrying him into an accidental collision. After finishing his treatment, he is shown his second booking of the match before being given his marching orders. Wolves are down to 10 men!,3
RED CARD FOR OTAVIO! Otavio receives a second yellow card after a late tackle on Calhanoglu on the edge of Porto's box. The away side will have to play 12 minutes with 10 men.,3
VIEIRA IS SENT OFF! Taylor nods the ball down to Brownhill, who is the favourite to get to it. Vieira sticks a leg out almost lazily, and he catches the Burnley midfielder high on the shin. The collision looked accidental, but it's a really poor challenge and he's given his marching orders. Arsenal will finish the game with 10 men.,3
OFF! Tuta pulls back Son again and receives his second yellow card and then a red. The referee had to be reminded that he booked the Frankfurt defender not three minutes ago.,3
Paredes does not escape unpunished, with the Argentina international also shown a red card for his part in the fracas. He's having to be contained by two team-mates while he yells something to his opponents during the slow march off the pitch.,3
Caprari fouls Demiral and picks up his second yellow card of the game. He's off and Sampdoria are down to 10 men!,3
BROZOVIC IS SENT OFF! BOTH SIDES DOWN TO 10! In order to prevent a counter-attack, Brozovic goes lunging into a tackle on Cuadrado, which catches the full-back squarely. The cynical challenge draws the 10th yellow card of the game, but its Brozovic’s second of the evening - sending him to the locker room.,3
JAGIELKA IS SENT OFF!!! After a lengthy review from the referee, he deems that Jagielka was indeed the last man and the Sheffield United defender is dismissed. Some would say that's a harsh decision in truth. ,3
BISSOUMA IS OFF! It's a reckless challenge from Bissouma as he was way over the ball which was at Yates' feet. He made contact with the Forest captain after he played the pass, and caught him very high with his studs. He's trying to protest his innocence, but the referee makes the right decision by upgrading the card to red after looking at the replays on the monitor. Spurs are down to 10!,3
RED CARD! Quina is shown a second yellow card for a needless challenge in the middle of the pitch on Morata. Elche are down to nine men.,3
RED CARD! Hermoso receives a second yellow card after a poor sliding challenge on Palacios! It is now 10 against 10.,3
RED CARD! Verdu is shown a red card after he brings Morata down to stop a clear goal-scoring opportunity just outside the box!,3
RED CARD! Villarreal will finish the tie with 10 men as Capoue is given his marching orders. The midfielder, who grabbed two assists earlier in the game, is shown a second yellow card for bringing down Jones.,3
RED CARD! CASEMIRO IS OFF! Anthony Taylor watches the incident back, and the Brazilian can have absolutely no complaints as his yellow card is upgraded to a red. His challenge took him over the top of the ball, and while there was no ill intent, Alcaraz could have been hurt. Casemiro is distraught as he trudges from the field.,3
Guilavogui sees a second yellow for the challenge leading to the penalty after he was previously booked.,3
RED CARD FOR TADIC! The Ajax captain picks up his second yellow card for using his arm to muscle over Olivera. Things are going from bad to worse for the hosts!,3
MEDEL IS SENT OFF TOO! BOLOGNA DOWN TO NINE! Incensed with the referee's decision to send off Soumaoro, the Chile international has far too much to say to the match official and earns two yellow cards in quick succession as he's sent off as well!,3
RED CARD FOR GARCIA! Garcia receives a second yellow card for hauling down Ramos seconds after he came on. The defender's dismissed and Barca will have to see out the remainder of this game with 10 men.,3
RED CARD FOR LEICESTER! After the goal Soyuncu gets caught up in an altercation with Callum Wilson in the net before lashing out and putting the striker on the floor. VAR checks it and decides the centre-back has kicked out and will have to go for violent conduct. What was he thinking there? ,3
IT’S A SECOND YELLOW IN TWO MINUTES FOR LODI! THE LEFT-BACK IS SENT OFF! During an aerial duel, the LaLiga debutant climbs on the back of Suarez - sending the Getafe player to the floor and slapping him in the face in the process. The referee does not hesitate and shows him a second booking! It’s 10 against 10!,3
Wan-Bissaka is off! It's a disappointing end to an encouraging performance for the 20-year-old. He left the referee with no choice, stretching to cut down Salah with the Egypt international clean through for a one-on-one.,3
OFF! Leeds are not only behind for the first time, but they are now down to 10 men too! Adams gets his marching orders for a deliberate trip on Bissouma in midfield - his second yellow-card offence of the second half.,3
Spurs are going to finish this game a man down though; Doherty crashes into Hernandez and picks up a second yellow, seeing him sent off for a second bookable offence. He'll be suspended too.,3
FIRPO IS OFF! Schar plays another brilliant long ball over the top and Gordon is running onto it. Firpo gets tight to him, clumsily clipping his heels to take off his boot and give away a free-kick to the right of the D. Gordon was the last man, and it looks to be a straight red, despite the Spaniard having already been booked. Leeds have to play six added minutes with 10 men!,3
DIALLO IS OFF! After picking up a booking for preventing a quick Liverpool free-kick earlier, the goalscorer took his shirt off in celebration to show it to the crowd. He doesn't seem to care too much as he's given a second yellow card, and United will see out the last couple of minutes with 10 men!,3
Diop must walk, as he has already been booked and now commits a foul in the penalty area. That caps off a bad day for Fulham's defence.,3
HE'S OFF!!! Bissouma drives through the middle before going down under pressure on the edge of the box. It wasn't enough pressure though, says the referee, who shows the midfielder a second yellow card for simulation and then produces the red! After a first-half they've dominated, Spurs will now have to play out the rest of the game a player down!,3
SALERNITANA DOWN TO 10 MEN! It’s an unfortunate start to the second half for Maggiore, who has turned from hero to villain after taking Rabiot’s legs out from underneath him 24 yards from goal. Already on a yellow card, the referee is forced to book him for a second time and give him his marching orders, with the Granata forced to see out the remainder of the game down a man!,3
MITROVIC IS OFF TOO! Fulham have completely lost their heads here! Mitrovic went straight over to the referee as he was showing the red card to Willian, and he crosses a line with what he said before pushing the referee and putting his head towards him. Fulham are down to nine men in a matter of seconds!,3
RED CARD! Vinicius has been shown a red card. Mamardashvili got in the face of the winger, causing Madrid and Valencia players to argue. He is shown a red card for pushing Duro in the face after a VAR check. Duro goes unpunished for putting the winger in a headlock.,3
Stepinski attempts to hook the ball over Musacchio's head, but ends up catching the defender in the face with his boot and is shown a yellow card. However, upon consulting with VAR the referee decides to send the Polish striker off!  ,3
ANOTHER RED CARD! IT'S 10 AGAINST 10 HERE! Souza is shown a second yellow card for Espanyol in the aftermath of a foul on Lewandowski, which provoked a chaotic confrontation between both teams! Espanyol have squandered their numerical advantage!,3
HE'S OFF!!!! It's a second yellow in as many minutes for Barcola!!! Frustrations boil over for the young PSG wideman, who needlessly swipes at the legs of Brahimi, gets nowhere near the ball, and is shown another yellow card by the referee! He's not the only frustrated one, with PSG fans who've seen their side blow a 2-0 lead voicing their frustrations at the 21-year-old!,3
Kimpembe originally goes into the book for a lunge on NDombele, but the decision is later changed to a red card. ,3
Sent off! Ugarte receives a second yellow after a very reckless sliding challenge on Saka in midfield. That was a really poor tackle.,3
RED CARD FOR STRUIJK! After examining Elliott the referee reaches to his pocket and dismisses Struijk. Both Leeds and Liverpool players console the defender as he leaves the pitch. Klopp is in furious discussion with the officials. He's clearly disgusted by the tackle.,3
ROCA IS OFF!!! The central midfielder recieves a second yellow card and his marching orders for a late challenge on Junuzovic. That could be a game changer!,3
ESPANYOL DOWN TO 10 MEN! Lozano follows through on Pique and is shown a yellow card. However, like the Fati decision a couple of minutes ago, the referee checks the pitchside monitor and changes his initial decision.,3
RED CARD! After being shown a second yellow card, Jordan is now making his way around the pitch with his head in his hands. He pulled back Adeyemi, who was trying to launch a counter-attack for Salzburg. ,3
PENALTY! Kanga let the ball roll past him, shielding Marquinhos and the PSG captain hacks down the Angers man from behind... AND IS SHOWN RED! PSG are down to 10 men!,3
HE'S OFF! For his heated protests about being booked just moments before, Felix is swiftly shown a second yellow card and must exit not long after coming off the bench. Incredible stuff! Can Athletic now capitalise on having the extra man?,3
RED CARD! Sanchez is off as he gets a second yellow card for diving! Martinez gets in behind and sees his shot saved by Audero. Sanchez latches onto the rebound in the box and goes down too easily for the referee's liking! Inter are down to 10 men!,3
VENEZIA DOWN TO 10! It's gone from bad to worse for the hosts! The referee had a perfect view of the whole thing, and he's called Svoboda across to show him a straight red card for the handball which denied the goalscoring opportunity.,3
OFF! Rashford is sent off for the first time in his career. He rages at Bardsley for tripping him on the byline. He presses his head against the full-back, making contact. The referee spots the incident and gives the forward his marching orders.,3
Having followed through slightly in a challenge with Lynen in midfield, Haberer is rather harshly shown a second yellow card. He's sent off, having only come on as a substitute earlier in the second half!,3
RED CARD! Neto slips the ball in behind for Willian Jose and David Luiz catches the striker's heels in the box as he's one-on-one with Leno! The referee points to the spot for a penalty and shows the Brazilian defender a straight red card! ,3
OFF! As expected, Lens' ill discipline finally results in the visitors going down to 10 men! Guilavogui catches Boscagli with a mistimed challenge and picks up his second booking since arriving from the bench!,3
BREWSTER IS SENT OFF!!! The VAR takes a look, and after sending the referee to the pitchside monitor, Brewster receives his marching orders. It was a very late and needless challenge, and the substitute is sent for an early bath.,3

De Ligt does handle the ball in the box and the referee dismisses the defender for two bookable offences.,3

Chelsea down to 10, and there was simply no question over what colour that card would be.,3
RED CARD! NAPOLI DOWN TO 10! During Caputo’s medical check on the pitch, the referee goes across to have a look at his monitor. Upon replay, it’s clear that the damage done to Caputo was caused by Rui’s kick-out following the coming-together, with his foot landing in a very sensitive area of the striker’s body.

A harsh one to say the least.,3
Ellingsen is off! It's a second yellow and Molde are down to 10 men! Only seconds after his first booking, he lunges in with a challenge that catches Puertas and hacks him to the ground. There may be some theatrics in there, but the referee won't be swayed; Ellingsen is off!,3
LEIPZIG DOWN TO 10! Now then! Upamecano, booked for a foul on Srbeny earlier in the game, is shown a second yellow card for dissent. Unhappy with a decision that went against him, the centre-back booted the ball away and must now make his way down the tunnel.,3

The referee had a moment to think about it but ultimately brandishes the yellow - followed by a red!,3

RED CARD! Casimiro is shown his second yellow card of the game for a poor tackle on Mertens inside the box. Icardi will take the penalty.,3
ROBERTS IS OFF! Flekken goes long over the top to try and pick out Wissa's run off the back of Roberts.

He's saying he got the ball, but it's not going to stop him from being shown a second yellow card. Burnley are down to 10 men!,3
RED CARD FOR SKRINIAR! Possibly a huge moment in the game with Inter players protesting. Looking to clear the ball away, Skriniar's boot catches the head of Caputo who gets there first. The referee does not hesitate, getting out a second yellow card for the defender before showing the red.,3
