Conte's men had the better of the first half and took the lead through Candreva's close-range finish just before the interval. After squandering a number of decent opportunities to double their advantage early in the second half, Inter were pegged back by Caceres' header. It took just seven minutes for Barella to restore their lead, though, with the midfielder firing a long-range volley into the bottom corner to send his side through.\n",

Vecino had earlier come close for the hosts with his long-range shot, while Sanchez had half a chance fairly early on.\n",

Sanchez is also handed a rare start just off the front two and Vecino comes into midfield, taking over from Sensi and Valero respectively. New signing Eriksen is among the subs.\n",
